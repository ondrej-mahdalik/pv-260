# PV260 Software Quality project


## Process Modeling & Event Storming
We have performed a thorough process modeling and event storming to better visualize and understand the system's flow.

You can view the detailed process models and event storming diagrams in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/2nc9rLTN6H6vEw8kRaJcw4/Event-Storming-(Community)?node-id=48-13171&t=HooV3KFXS7eQsvSa-1).

## User Stories
The user stories have been meticulously created and organized in [Jira](https://pv260.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/IN/boards/1) for ease of tracking and development.

Each of us voted on story points to estimate the effort for each user story. The majority of us voted similarly, typically agreeing on 5 story points as a common estimate for most tasks.
