# PV260 Software Quality project


## Process Modeling & Event Storming
We have performed a thorough process modeling and event storming to better visualize and understand the system's flow.

You can view the detailed process models and event storming diagrams in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/2nc9rLTN6H6vEw8kRaJcw4/Event-Storming-(Community)?node-id=48-13171&t=HooV3KFXS7eQsvSa-1).

## User Stories
The user stories have been meticulously created and organized in [Jira](https://pv260.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/IN/boards/1) for ease of tracking and development. To access the Jira you need to log in with an account from @mail.muni.cz domain.

Each of us voted on story points to estimate the effort for each user story. The majority of us voted similarly on each of the tasks.

## Git Conventions
When working on a story, add its key to the branch name and commit message so that it can be linked with Jira. Also include the Jira key in the pull request name.

## CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflows are used for CI/CD. For each Pull Request, a unit tests check is run. Also, after each commit to main, client and server binaries are compiled and a (pre)release is autogenerated.
Furthermore, a Docker image is built for the API server, pushed to the Packages repository, and deployed on the Staging server.
